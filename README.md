# Common Workflow Language Website 2.0

A Rewrite and expansion of the [CWL Website](https://commonwl.org), using Jekyll. The current staging site is https://github.com/lunacodes/cwl-staging

## Staging Issues

* Top Nav needs to re-integrate logic checks for http and https

## Video Player

* plyr.js
* Homepage video player code in `_includes/home/video-player.html`
* Move progress bar above controls?
* Change background color on Play, to avoid whitewash

### Subtitles

* Were downloaded from DownSub and converted to .vtt via https://subtitletools.com/convert-to-vtt-online/
* A list of srclang codes can be found here: https://www.footprintaddons.com/my-account/articles-news/282-language-codes-subtitle-tracks

### Autogenerated Subtitles

* We can optionally downloads YouTube's auto-generated subtitles via https://downsub.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D86eY8xs-Vo8

### Plyr API options

```js
controls: [
    'play-large', // The large play button in the center
    'restart', // Restart playback
    'rewind', // Rewind by the seek time (default 10 seconds)
    'play', // Play/pause playback
    'fast-forward', // Fast forward by the seek time (default 10 seconds)
    'progress', // The progress bar and scrubber for playback and buffering
    'current-time', // The current time of playback
    'duration', // The full duration of the media
    'mute', // Toggle mute
    'volume', // Volume control
    'captions', // Toggle captions

    'fullscreen', // Toggle fullscreen
];
```

* Double-check Aria Roles and other accessibility

### SEO Tags

See [Jekyll SEO Tag - Usage](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/docs/usage.md) for more info.

We could add any of the following SEO tags to `_config.yml`:

* tagline
* google_site_verification
* webmaster_verification (only necessary if we verify on more than google)

```yaml
# Example for webmaster verification

webmaster_verifications:
  google: 1234
  bing: 1234
  alexa: 1234
  yandex: 1234
  baidu: 1234
```

locale: en_US

## Notes

* Any URLs to the User Guide site have been left with the full `https://commonwl.org/` stem instead of `{{ site.url }}`, since the User Guide isn't mirrored on the staging server (and thus the links would break)
