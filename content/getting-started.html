Below are some useful resources to getting started.  Additionally, help is available through [community resources](/community) such as the [CWL Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#common-workflow-language_common-workflow-language:gitter.im).

* Learn to write CWL using the [CWL user guide](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/) which provides a gentle introduction to creating CWL command line tool and workflow descriptions.
* Browse [CWL Implementations](/implementations/) to find a software package that's right for you.
* Follow [CWL Recommended Practices](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/topics/best-practices.html#best-practices) to make your CWL tools and workflows more efficient, reusable and transparent.
* Read <a href="https://github.com/pitagora-galaxy/cwl/wiki/CWL-Start-Guide-JP" lang="ja" hreflang="ja">CWLの日本語での解説ドキュメント</a>  a 15 minute introduction to the CWL project in Japanese.
* Watch a series of [video lessons about CWL](https://stepik.org/lesson/35918/step/1?unit=15070) in Russian as part of the <a href="https://stepik.org/course/1612/syllabus" lang="ru">Управление вычислениями</a> (Computation Management) free online course.
* Find [CWL descriptions for life-science tools](https://github.com/common-workflow-library/bio-cwl-tools) to use directly or incorporate into your workflows.

Finally, the most comprehensive information about the CWL standards is contained in the <a href="https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/">specifications themselves</a>, but they are the least friendly resource for newcomers.
