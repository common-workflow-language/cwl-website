|[Bio-compute objects](https://osf.io/h59uh/)|"a step towards evaluation and validation of bio-medical scientific computations", CWL and researchobject.org participants are cooperating with this effort|
|[European Open Science Cloud](https://www.eosc-portal.eu/about/eosc)|The CWL project is [signatory](https://www.eosc-portal.eu/about/eosc-doers) to the [EOSC Declaration](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/eosc_declaration.pdf#view=fit&pagemode=none) and is a core enabling standard for two of the EOSCPilot Science Demonstrations:  [LOFAR - Astrophysics Data](https://eoscpilot.eu/lofar-data) and [eWaterCycle & SWITCH-ON – FAIR Data for Hydrology](https://eoscpilot.eu/earth-sciences-%E2%80%93-hydrology-switching-eosc-reproducible-computational-hydrology-fairifying)|
|[GA4GH Task Execution API](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas/)|a minimal common API for submitting a single job to a remote execution endpoint. Many contributions from CWL project participants.|
|[GA4GH Workflow Execution API](https://github.com/ga4gh/workflow-execution-schemas)|a minimal common API for submitting workflow requests to workflow execution systems in a standardized way. Many contributions from CWL project participants.|
|[ResearchObjects.org](http://www.researchobject.org/)|"an emerging approach to the publication, and exchange of scholarly information on the Web." CWL participants and RO enthusiasts have created [CWLProv](https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/), a profile for provenance research object of a CWL workflow run.|
