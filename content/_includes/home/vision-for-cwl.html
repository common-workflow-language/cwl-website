<!-- ## Vision for the CWL Project -->
_What this community hopes to have accomplished in the future_

Researchers, scientists, and analysts share their batch data analysis workflows without technical barriers using an open standard.  Sharing workflows this way is a usual occurrence and seen as a typical way of working.  The workflows are complete and run on a variety of environments; and people re-use shared workflow descriptions and build new workflows from them. No vendor dominates the ecosystem

<!-- ### Mission of the CWL Project -->
_How we plan to achieve our vision_

The CWL project supports open consensus-based standards for command line data analysis
workflows and tools.

Specifically, we support the
* pre-standards process by providing a neutral place of convening to discuss, propose and
test ideas about command-line tool based workflow standards and related topics
* standardization process by stewarding the development and delivery of standards in
accordance with the [Open Stand principles](https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/).  
* post-standards life cycle by (1) promoting the released standards, (2) developing and maintaining
related training and tools, and by (3) tracking deficits and other post-standardization feedback.
