        description: Microbiome research involves the study of all genomes present within a specific environment. The approach can provide unique insights into the complex processes performed by environmental micro-organisms and their relationship to their surroundings, to each other, and, in some cases, to their host. MGnify offers an automated pipeline for the analysis and archiving of microbiome data to help determine the taxonomic diversity and functional & metabolic potential of environmental samples. Users can submit their own data for analysis or freely browse all of the analysed public datasets held within the repository. In addition, users can request analysis of any appropriate dataset within the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)</a>. User-submitted or ENA-derived datasets can also be assembled on request, prior to analysis. In an effort to enable transparency of the analysis pipelines, particularly in terms of the tools (and their versions), parameters and reference databases that we employ, we have implemented our pipelines using the CWL standards.

        description: Together with other disciplines, plant research increasingly relying on effective research data management services and infrastructures that facilitate the acquisition, archival, exchange, and processing of research data sets, to enable the exchange of interdisciplinary expertise. While various suggestions on best practices for FAIR data have been made, it is nevertheless always up to individual researchers` initiative and additional effort to adhere to them. Focused on its core mission to minimize the additional work of research data management, DataPLANT wants to support plant researchers in practice, providing technical services and infrastructure and personal support. Therefore, DataPLANT as the <a href='https://www.nfdi.de/' title='NFDI'>NFDI</a> (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur) for plant research, works in a data-centric way and builds on existing structures. A central element for achieving the goal is the <a href='https://nfdi4plants.org/content/learn-more/annotated-research-context.html' title='Annotated Research Context'>Annotated Research Context</a> (ARC), which acts as single entry point and will define the structure of a future data publication. ARCs are FAIR Digital Objects covering the entire research cycle, from the experiment to the computational aspects to the actual data and metadata, as well as the resulting data publications using existing repositories. The computations that are stored inside an ARC are powered by the Common Workflow Language standards which enable researchers to describe standalone- or delegation workflows. This allows the integration and combination of workflows that were created using various workflow systems and languages while maintaining a uniform metadata description format on the top layer. Several tools and services are already available to ensure working with ARCs without friction in a collaborative research environment. Accordingly, DataPLANT represents the central point of contact for plant researchers to set up appropriate research data management.

          The NBDC-DDBJ Imputation Server enables accurate genotype imputation by leveraging controlled access datasets of the Japanese population. The server is made up of three modules: a workflow execution system, computational workflows specifying the inputs, steps, and outputs of genotype imputation, and a secure web user interface that allows users to specify parameters. Additionally, the server offers reference panels that are ready to use, saving users from having to perform laborious computations on whole-genome sequencing data. With its fully containerized implementation in CWL, the entire system is portable.
