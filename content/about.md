The CWL Project began out of a need for a standard to 
describe analysis pipelines in a portable and reusable
manner. Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a family of standards
for the description of command line tools and of workflows made with these standards.
CWL is designed to meet the needs of data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Astronomy, High Energy Physics, and Machine Learning.


The CWL project focus is on open standards, open-source code and an open community.

#### What this community hopes to have accomplished in the future

Researchers, scientists, and analysts share their batch data analysis workflows without technical barriers using an open standard. Sharing workflows this way is a usual occurrence and seen as a typical way of working. The workflows are complete and run on a variety of environments; and people re-use shared workflow descriptions and build new workflows from them. No vendor dominates the ecosystem

#### How we plan to achieve our vision

The CWL project supports open consensus-based standards for command line data analysis workflows and tools.

Specifically, we support the
*    pre-standards process by providing a neutral place of convening to discuss, propose and test ideas about command-line tool based workflow standards and related topics
*    standardization process by stewarding the development and delivery of standards in accordance with the Open Stand principles.
*    post-standards life cycle by (1) promoting the released standards, (2) developing and maintaining related training and tools, and by (3) tracking deficits and other post-standardization feedback
