  The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for describing
  analysis workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable
  across a variety of software and hardware environments, from workstations
  to cluster, cloud, and high performance computing (HPC) environments.
  CWL is designed to meet the needs of data-intensive science, such as
  Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging, Astronomy, High Energy Physics, and
  Machine Learning.
