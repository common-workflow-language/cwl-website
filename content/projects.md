|[BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/)|"A step towards evaluation and validation of bio-medical scientific computations", CWL and researchobject.org participants are cooperating with this effort, formalized as standard [IEEE 2791-2020](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/ieee-standard-for-bioinformatics-analyses-generated-by-highthroughput-sequencing-hts-to-facilitate-communication(936de52b-ac53-4f0e-9927-77fd7073e88d).html)|
|[European Open Science Cloud](https://www.eosc-portal.eu/about/eosc)|The CWL project is [signatory](https://www.eosc-portal.eu/about/eosc-doers) to the [EOSC Declaration](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/eosc_declaration.pdf#view=fit&pagemode=none) and is a core enabling standard for two of the EOSCPilot Science Demonstrations:  [LOFAR - Astrophysics Data](https://eoscpilot.eu/lofar-data) and [eWaterCycle & SWITCH-ON â€“ FAIR Data for Hydrology](https://eoscpilot.eu/earth-sciences-%E2%80%93-hydrology-switching-eosc-reproducible-computational-hydrology-fairifying)|
|[GA4GH Task Execution API](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas/)|A minimal common API for submitting a single job to a remote execution endpoint. Many contributions from CWL project participants|
|[GA4GH Workflow Execution API](https://github.com/ga4gh/workflow-execution-schemas)|A minimal common API for submitting workflow requests to workflow execution systems in a standardized way. Many contributions from CWL project participants|
|[Research Object](http://www.researchobject.org/)|"An emerging approach to the publication, and exchange of scholarly information on the Web." Derived from provenance profile [CWLProv](https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/), the newest specification [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate) has profiles for [workflows](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/) and [workflow runs](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/)|
