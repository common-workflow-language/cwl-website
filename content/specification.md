# Specification

<figure class="float-right"><a href="https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles" class="open-stand"><picture><source srcset="https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl-website/raw/main/openstand-128x128-blue.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="./Common Workflow Language_files/openstand-128x128-blue.png" alt="Open Stand badge - the modern paradigm for standards" width="128" height="128"></picture></a></figure>

Common Workflow Language (CWL) is developed by a multi-vendor working group consisting of organizations and individuals aiming to enable scientists to share data analysis workflows. The CWL project is [maintained on Github](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/) and we follow the [Open-Stand.org principles](https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/) for collaborative open standards development. Legally CWL is a member project of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) and is formally managed by the elected CWL leadership team, however everyday project decisions are made by the CWL community which is open for participation by anyone.

The CWL project produces free and open standards for describing command-line tool based workflows. These standards are [implemented](/implementations/) in many popular workflow systems.

For developers and advanced users, the current [CWL Standards v1.2.0](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/) provides authoritative documentation of the execution of CWL documents. The previous versions, [CWL Standards v1.0.2](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/) and [CWL Standards v1.1.0](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.1/), are also available.
