## What can execute CWL descriptions?
CWL provides a
solution to describing portable, re-usable workflows while also
being workflow-engine and vendor-neutral.
CWL has gained much traction and is currently widely
supported in practice. In addition to the Free and Open Source implementations, certain platforms/engines have in-development or partial support for CWL as well.

Some workflow users require the maintenance and risk-mitigation
guarantees offered by commercial operations. There are multiple
commercially supported systems that support CWL for executing
workflows and they are available from vendors such as Curii
([Arvados](https://arvados.org/)), [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/), [IBM (IBMÂ® Spectrum LSF)](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spectrum-computing), [Illumina
(Illumina Connected Analytics)](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/connected-analytics.html?scid=2021-269ECL4851), and [Seven Bridges Genomics](https://www.sevenbridges.com/).

Wide adoption benefits from our principles: CWL offers
conformance tests, but the CWL community does not yet test or certify
CWL implementations, or specific technology stacks. Instead,
plaform/service providers self-certify support for CWL, based on a
particular technology configuration they deploy and maintain.
